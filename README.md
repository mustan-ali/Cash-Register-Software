The goal of the program is to assist the cashier in taking the customer's orders. The program will
present the menu to the cashier. The cashier will be able to select the products by pressing the
corresponding numbers on the menu list. When the order is complete, the computer will generate a
bill that includes GST. The program then allows the cashier to enter the amount paid by the customer.
The application will then compute the amount of the return and display it.
